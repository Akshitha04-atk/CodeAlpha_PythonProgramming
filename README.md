# CodeAlpha_PythonProgramming
This project is a Python-based console application that includes two mini programs:  1. Hangman Game üéÆ   2. Rule-Based Chatbot ü§ñ    Both programs demonstrate the use of core programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, string manipulation, and user input/output in Python. They are designed to be interactive and beginner friendly.
Absolutely! Here's a complete project description that combines both your tasks: the Hangman Game and the Basic Chatbot, ideal for submitting as a school/college-level Python project.
