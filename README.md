# CodeAlpha_PythonProgramming
This project is a Python-based console application that includes two mini programs:  1. Hangman Game 🎮   2. Rule-Based Chatbot 🤖    Both programs demonstrate the use of core programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, string manipulation, and user input/output in Python. They are designed to be interactive and beginner friendly.
Absolutely! Here's a complete project description that combines both your tasks: the Hangman Game and the Basic Chatbot, ideal for submitting as a school/college-level Python project.

💡 Tools Used: Python 3, Console Input/Output, Basic Emojis


1️⃣ Task 1: Hangman Game 🎮

✅ Description:

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where:

The computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list of 5 words.

The player guesses one letter at a time.

The player has a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses before the game ends.

Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word.

Incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts.

🧠 Concepts Used:

random.choice() for word selection

while loop for game flow

if-else logic for checking letters

lists and strings for displaying progress

Console input/output with emoji responses for feedback (✅, ❌, 💀, 🎉)

2️⃣ Task 2: Basic Rule-Based Chatbot 🤖

✅ Description:

A simple chatbot that simulates conversation based on rule matching:

Responds to inputs like “hello”, “how are you”, “bye”, etc.

Provides predefined answers using if-elif-else.

Handles unknown inputs with a fallback message.

Can be enhanced to recognize keywords using in operator.

Emojis like 👋, 😊, and ❌ are used to make replies more expressive.

🧠 Concepts Used:

functions to define chatbot behavior

while loop for ongoing conversation

if-elif-else decision structure

string.lower() and in for keyword matching

Basic emoji output in terminal

🚀 Conclusion

This mini project demonstrates how core programming concepts in Python can be applied to create engaging console-based applications. The Hangman Game encourages logical thinking and loop-based programming, while the Chatbot emphasizes decision-making and interaction. Emoji integration adds a modern and playful touch to the command-line interface.
